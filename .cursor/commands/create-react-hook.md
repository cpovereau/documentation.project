# create-react-hook

# Create Custom React Hook
This command generates a new custom React hook.

Ask the user for:
- hook name (must start with 'use')
- target folder inside src/hooks

Rules:
- Create a new .ts file with the hook name
- Use TypeScript strict typings
- Include a clear return shape
- No external libraries unless already used in Documentum
- Add JSDoc explaining the purpose of the hook
- Keep the hook pure unless it interacts with Zustand or TipTap explicitly

This command will be available in chat with /create-react-hook
