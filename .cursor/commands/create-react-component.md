# create-react-component

# Create React Component
This command generates a new React component using:
- TypeScript
- functional components only
- Tailwind CSS classes
- clean and consistent file structure

Ask the user for:
- component name
- target folder inside src/

Rules:
- Create a .tsx file named after the component
- Use named export, not default export
- Include an empty props interface
- Keep styling minimal with Tailwind
- Do not add external libraries
- Respect Documentum folder structure
- Use PascalCase file naming

This command will be available in chat with /create-react-component
